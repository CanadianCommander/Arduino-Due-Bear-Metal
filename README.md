# Arduino Due Bear Metal

example code for blinking the led on an Arduino Due using bear metal programming. (Arduino IDE uploads 22 kB ish to flash 
for its blink lead example while this uploads only 352 bytes!)
I'm putting this up here in the hopes that it might help some one else. god knows it took 
me all day to get this thing working.

My big break came when looking at this repo : https://github.com/hannobraun/embedded
